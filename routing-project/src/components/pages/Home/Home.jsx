                <p>Choosing sustainability isn't the easy route, it's the only route. The apparel industry is 
                    the fourth largest polluter of air and water on Earth. The solution? Go sustainable, or go nude.
                    Minimizing our environmental impact and helping clean up the apparel industry is an 
                    integral part of our business ethos.

            <h2>1% For the Planet</h2>
            <p>is a global network of businesses, individuals, and nonprofits working to tackle 
                our planet's most pressing environmental issues. As a member, we give 1% of all sales back to environmental non-profits 
                and get our hands dirty regularly volunteering with organizations to restore trails, clean up our coastline and plant trees. 
                We’re an active member in our local 1% for the Planet community and organize film festivals, environmental discussion panels
                 and public outreach events to raise funds and awareness for our nonprofit partners.</p>
                 <h2>The Conservation Alliance</h2>
                 <p>partners with grassroots environmental organizations to protect the wild places we all love. 
                    We joined The Conservation Alliance in 2006, making us a proud member for over a decade. Each year we participate in 
                    The Conservation Alliance’s Backyard Collective, a day of local environmental activism, and every Toad gets to vote on grant 
                    nominations each year to determine which conservation projects will receive funding. </p>
