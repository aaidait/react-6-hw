            <p>From the mountains of Colorado to the beaches of California, and Portlands in Maine and Oregon,
                to main streets across the country, there’s a Toad just about everywhere these days. But like most great things,
                it all started with humble beginnings: just one woman in a garage in Telluride, CO making handmade toque hats for
                her friends. It was 1991 and fleece hats were all the rage – right up there with REM singles and two-way pagers.
